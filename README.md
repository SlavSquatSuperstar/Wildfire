# Wildfire

Infection themed-video game developed in 30 hours for my high-school senior project.

Created with Java using the Greenfoot Platform and ported to Gradle. Huge thanks to Benoit
Heinrich's [Greenfoot Runner](https://github.com/benoitheinrich/greenfoot-runner) repository for preserving my sanity.
